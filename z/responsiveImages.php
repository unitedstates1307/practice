  <h1 class="post-title">The Image Alignment Conundrum</h1>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p class="intro">The challenge seems simple on paper but hard in CSS: Without changing the HTML markup, allow for various alignments in a single view, including centered elements, floated elements, half-bleed elements, and full-bleed elements. It seems the best approach to half- and full-bleed is using CSS Grid, but that stands in the way of floats.</p>
    <p><em>Current solution: Regular content is aligned using standard <code>max-width</code> and <code>margin: 0 auto;</code>. Special alignment <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> elements are turned into grid containers spanning the full width of the available space using a ridiculous <code>calc</code> formula, and the images and captions within are placed on the individual grids. Salient CSS bits start at line 69.</em></p>
    <p class="intro">Descriptions of each alignment are found under each image.</p>

    <p>Elements with the class <code>align-center</code> are centered with a max width matching the max width of the main content. If an element is narrower than the width, it is center aligned leaving equal space on both sides.</p> 
    <h2>Left-aligned</h2>
